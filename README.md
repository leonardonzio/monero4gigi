## To remember

- Almost every crypto project is a scam, an easy way for unethical people to make quick money.
- On the Internet, anonymity is a myth.
- The blockchain revolution promised decentralization but delivered new forms of centralized power.  
e.g. :  
    - Mining pools:  
        Mining is concentrated in few large mining pools, e.g. before 2021 in China:

    - Whale concentration:  
        Small number of wallets hold very dispoportionate amounts of many cryptos. (Top 10000 Bitcoin holders controlled about 27% of all Bitcoin, source https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29396/w29396.pdf)
    - Exchanges:  
        There is 0 decentralization in centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinase and the now incrimanated FTX.  
        They all represent single points of failure. The opposite of decentralization.
